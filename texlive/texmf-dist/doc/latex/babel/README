Babel 3.9h
----------

This is Babel 3.9h.

Version 3.9a fixed lots of bugs and added some new features, intended
mainly to make it compatible somehow with Unicode engines. Some bugs
have not been fixed to avoid backward incompatibilities, but they have
been documented. Most of the new features (like package options) are
intended to overcome issues in previous releases without changing
significantly the behaviour of Babel.

Languages are not part of the Babel core any more; in particular, it
shall be no longer necessary to synchronize Babel core releases with
releases of Babel language files. See CONTRIB for further details
about contributing a language.

To install it, just tex babel.ins and move the generated files to the
corresponding place in your TeX distribution. Unlike former releases,
formats must not be recreated, but it is recommended, at least the
first time Babel is updated from 3.8 (or previous versions). 

Changes are described in babel.pdf with the label "New 3.9". The
manual has been expanded to include tips and tricks, but it will be
improved in next releases.

Please, report bugs and suggestions to:

http://latex-project.org/bugs-upload.html

You may also report them to the author more informally on:

http://www.tex-tipografia.com/contact.html

Bugs related to specific languages are best reported to their
respective authors.
